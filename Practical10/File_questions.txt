Question: plot a boxplot of DALYs distribution of all countries in 1990
Line number: from 48 to 64
Result Discussion:
1. My motivation of doing this task:
   It is important to know the distribution of the DALYs of all the countries if we want to get an overview and conduct horizontal comparison.
Through this process, we can know the mean, the outliers and the range of the DALYs.
2. My plan/thinking process:
   Firstly, I need to extract all the data of 1990.
   Then, I need to decide my title, x/y axis of the graph.
   Next, I can use the boxplot command to draw the graph.
3. The result explanation:
   The result is what I have expected: the box is in the center, with lines showing its mean values, quartiles and outliers.
   As for why the data looks like this, I used many parameters to achieve this:
        1. "vert = True" means the box will be vertical rather than lie flatly
        2. "whis = 1.5" defines the appropriate width of the box
        3. "patch_artist = True" will fill the box with color, preventing an empty box
        4. "meanline = True" will show the mean line in the box
        5. "showbox = True" and "showcaps = True" help show the outline/rough sketch of the box
        6. "showfliers = True" will show the outliers
        7. "notch = False" prevents importing gaps in the graph
    By setting these parameters, I can have a picture of what the graph looks like.

1. The length and subcellular localisation of the human SOD2 protein:
   The length is 222 amino acids. The protein is in the mitochondrion matrix.
2. The range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST results:
   Human SOD: 58.1%--100%
   Mouse SOD: 57.3%--100%
3. The alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids for each of the three comparisons that you performed	using Python:
alignment score:
   Human and mouse: the alignment score is: 1097.0
   Human and random: the alignment score is: -227.0
   Mouse and random: the alignment score is: -235.0
percentage of identical amino acids
   Human and mouse: the identity percentage is: 90.09%
   Human and random: the identity percentage is: 4.95%
   Mouse and random: the identity percentage is: 4.50%
4. A statement recording which of these two sequences are most closely related:
   Human and Mouse genes are most closely related.

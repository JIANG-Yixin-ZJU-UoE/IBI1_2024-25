From this week's practical, I think it was difficult for me to do.:
    It was hard for me to draw four pictures together and update the data in each picture.
    Also, I spent a long time thinking how to infect the neighbors of one infected person.
I think the most exciting part is to look at the picture produced successfully, esp the third part. It was amazing to see how the disease spreads and decline.
I learned to reinforce the plotting skills learned last week and got to know how to update the data from previous graphs.

During this course, I have learnt basic version control skills and how to navigate Unix-like systems.
Everything wasn't well at first because of the configuration of my computer and the failure of VPN. They were the indeed challenging things for me. 
Thanks for the help of the professor, now I overcome them and there are no more questions left!
